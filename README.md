## Introduction

This project aims to process and analyze conversations between customers and salesmen to assess their efficiency. The application uses Python with FastAPI for the backend, MongoDB for the database, and integrates machine learning models to provide insights.

## Features

- Efficient processing of large audio files and their transcripts.
- RESTful API with FastAPI.
- MongoDB for storing and managing conversation data.
- Scalable and containerized deployment using Docker.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Conda package manager
- MongoDB database
- Docker (optional for containerized deployment)

## Installation

### Setting Up the Environment

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

2. Create and activate a Conda environment:
   ```bash
   conda create -n your-env-name python=3.8
   conda activate your-env-name
   ```

3. Install the required Python packages:
